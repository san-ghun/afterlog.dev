> This post explains why I treat logging *after* building as the core of my thinking process.

I don’t log ideas before I build.  
I log what remains **after something has run**.

Plans are cheap.  
Execution produces friction.  
And friction leaves traces.

This blog exists to collect those traces.

## Thinking happens after execution

Most insights don’t appear while designing systems.  
They appear after something breaks, drifts, or quietly works in an unexpected way.

Only then do questions become precise.

- Why did this feel heavy?
- Why did this scale better than expected?
- Why did I stop using it?

Those questions don’t belong to planning documents.  
They belong to logs.

## Logs are not summaries

A log is not a conclusion.  
It is not a retrospective trying to sound wise.

A log is a **snapshot of a system in motion**.

Incomplete.  
Contextual.  
Time-bound.

That’s why I keep them separate from finished documentation.

## Afterlog

Afterlog is where I write *after* something has been built, run, or lived with.

Not to archive outcomes,  
but to preserve the conditions under which thinking occurred.

This is not a place for answers.

It is a place where answers start to decay —  
and better questions appear.
