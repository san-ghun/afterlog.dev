> This post explains why personal systems should be treated as living entities rather than static frameworks.

A personal system is not a framework you finish.

It is something you live inside.

And like all living things, it changes.

## Stability is not the goal

The goal is not to freeze a perfect setup.

The goal is to remain functional  
while your context shifts.

New responsibilities.  
New constraints.  
New energy levels.

A rigid system survives documentation,  
but fails real life.

## Decay is a signal, not a failure

When parts of a system stop being used,  
that is not a mistake.

It is information.

Ignoring decay leads to complexity.  
Observing decay leads to adaptation.

That is why I log what I abandon as carefully as what I keep.

## Versioning a life is impossible

You cannot version-control a human.

What you *can* do is leave traces of past states —  
why something existed,  
and why it stopped.

Those traces prevent you from repeating the same design mistakes  
under different names.

## Afterlog as memory tissue

This blog is part of that system.

Not as documentation,  
but as connective tissue between past and present thinking.

A personal system lives  
as long as it can remember why it changed.
